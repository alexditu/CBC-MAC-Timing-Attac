<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The <b>verify</b> command verifies certificate chains.</p>

<h1 id="COMMAND-OPTIONS">COMMAND OPTIONS</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="CApath-directory"><b>-CApath directory</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A directory of trusted certificates. The certificates should have names of the form: hash.0 or have symbolic links to them of this form (&quot;hash&quot; is the hashed certificate subject name: see the <b>-hash</b> option of the <b>x509</b> utility). Under Unix the <b>c_rehash</b> script will automatically create symbolic links to a directory of certificates.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="CAfile-file"><b>-CAfile file</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A file of trusted certificates. The file should contain multiple certificates in PEM format concatenated together.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="untrusted-file"><b>-untrusted file</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>A file of untrusted certificates. The file should contain multiple certificates in PEM format concatenated together.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="purpose-purpose"><b>-purpose purpose</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The intended use for the certificate. If this option is not specified, <b>verify</b> will not consider certificate purpose during chain verification. Currently accepted uses are <b>sslclient</b>, <b>sslserver</b>, <b>nssslserver</b>, <b>smimesign</b>, <b>smimeencrypt</b>. See the <b>VERIFY OPERATION</b> section for more information.</p>

<dd>

<p>Enable policy processing and add <b>arg</b> to the user-initial-policy-set (see RFC5280). The policy <b>arg</b> can be an object name an OID in numeric form. This argument can appear more than once.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="policy_check"><b>-policy_check</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Enables certificate policy processing.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="explicit_policy"><b>-explicit_policy</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Set policy variable require-explicit-policy (see RFC5280).</p>

<p>Checks the validity of <b>all</b> certificates in the chain by attempting to look up valid CRLs.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="ignore_critical"><b>-ignore_critical</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Normally if an unhandled critical extension is present which is not supported by OpenSSL the certificate is rejected (as required by RFC5280). If this option is set critical extensions are ignored.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="x509_strict"><b>-x509_strict</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>For strict X.509 compliance, disable non-compliant workarounds for broken certificates.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="check_ss_sig"><b>-check_ss_sig</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Verify the signature on the self-signed root CA. This is disabled by default because it doesn&#39;t add any security.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod"><b>-</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Indicates the last option. All arguments following this are assumed to be certificate files. This is useful if the first certificate filename begins with a <b>-</b>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="certificates"><b>certificates</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>One or more certificates to verify. If no certificates are given, <b>verify</b> will attempt to read a certificate from standard input. Certificates must be in PEM format.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="VERIFY-OPERATION">VERIFY OPERATION</h1>

<p>The <b>verify</b> program uses the same functions as the internal SSL and S/MIME verification, therefore this description applies to these verify operations too.</p>

<p>There is one crucial difference between the verify operations performed by the <b>verify</b> program: wherever possible an attempt is made to continue after an error whereas normally the verify operation would halt on the first error. This allows all the problems with a certificate chain to be determined.</p>

<p>The verify operation consists of a number of separate steps.</p>

<p>Firstly a certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied certificate and ending in the root CA. It is an error if the whole chain cannot be built up. The chain is built up by looking up the issuers certificate of the current certificate. If a certificate is found which is its own issuer it is assumed to be the root CA.</p>

<p>The process of &#39;looking up the issuers certificate&#39; itself involves a number of steps. In versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.5a the first certificate whose subject name matched the issuer of the current certificate was assumed to be the issuers certificate. In OpenSSL 0.9.6 and later all certificates whose subject name matches the issuer name of the current certificate are subject to further tests. The relevant authority key identifier components of the current certificate (if present) must match the subject key identifier (if present) and issuer and serial number of the candidate issuer, in addition the keyUsage extension of the candidate issuer (if present) must permit certificate signing.</p>

<p>The lookup first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no match is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates. The root CA is always looked up in the trusted certificate list: if the certificate to verify is a root certificate then an exact match must be found in the trusted list.</p>

<p>The second operation is to check every untrusted certificate&#39;s extensions for consistency with the supplied purpose. If the <b>-purpose</b> option is not included then no checks are done. The supplied or &quot;leaf&quot; certificate must have extensions compatible with the supplied purpose and all other certificates must also be valid CA certificates. The precise extensions required are described in more detail in the <b>CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS</b> section of the <b>x509</b> utility.</p>

<p>The third operation is to check the trust settings on the root CA. The root CA should be trusted for the supplied purpose. For compatibility with previous versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL a certificate with no trust settings is considered to be valid for all purposes.</p>

<p>The final operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain. The validity period is checked against the current system time and the notBefore and notAfter dates in the certificate. The certificate signatures are also checked at this point.</p>

<p>If all operations complete successfully then certificate is considered valid. If any operation fails then the certificate is not valid.</p>

<h1 id="DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</h1>

<p>When a verify operation fails the output messages can be somewhat cryptic. The general form of the error message is:</p>

<pre><code> server.pem: /C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA (1024 bit)
 error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate</code></pre>

<p>The first line contains the name of the certificate being verified followed by the subject name of the certificate. The second line contains the error number and the depth. The depth is number of the certificate being verified when a problem was detected starting with zero for the certificate being verified itself then 1 for the CA that signed the certificate and so on. Finally a text version of the error number is presented.</p>

<p>An exhaustive list of the error codes and messages is shown below, this also includes the name of the error code as defined in the header file x509_vfy.h Some of the error codes are defined but never returned: these are described as &quot;unused&quot;.</p>

<h1 id="BUGS">BUGS</h1>

<p>Although the issuer checks are a considerably improvement over the old technique they still suffer from limitations in the underlying X509_LOOKUP API. One consequence of this is that trusted certificates with matching subject name must either appear in a file (as specified by the <b>-CAfile</b> option) or a directory (as specified by <b>-CApath</b>. If they occur in both then only the certificates in the file will be recognised.</p>

<p>Previous versions of OpenSSL assume certificates with matching subject name are identical and mishandled them.</p>

<p>Previous versions of this documentation swapped the meaning of the <b>X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT</b> and <b>20 X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY</b> error codes.</p>
