<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>BIO_s_mem() return the memory BIO method function.</p>

<p>A memory BIO is a source/sink BIO which uses memory for its I/O. Data written to a memory BIO is stored in a BUF_MEM structure which is extended as appropriate to accommodate the stored data.</p>

<p>Any data written to a memory BIO can be recalled by reading from it. Unless the memory BIO is read only any data read from it is deleted from the BIO.</p>

<p>Memory BIOs support BIO_gets() and BIO_puts().</p>

<p>If the BIO_CLOSE flag is set when a memory BIO is freed then the underlying BUF_MEM structure is also freed.</p>

<p>Calling BIO_reset() on a read write memory BIO clears any data in it. On a read only BIO it restores the BIO to its original state and the read only data can be read again.</p>

<p>BIO_eof() is true if no data is in the BIO.</p>

<p>BIO_ctrl_pending() returns the number of bytes currently stored.</p>

<p>BIO_set_mem_eof_return() sets the behaviour of memory BIO <b>b</b> when it is empty. If the <b>v</b> is zero then an empty memory BIO will return EOF (that is it will return zero and BIO_should_retry(b) will be false. If <b>v</b> is non zero then it will return <b>v</b> when it is empty and it will set the read retry flag (that is BIO_read_retry(b) is true). To avoid ambiguity with a normal positive return value <b>v</b> should be set to a negative value, typically -1.</p>

<p>BIO_get_mem_data() sets <b>pp</b> to a pointer to the start of the memory BIOs data and returns the total amount of data available. It is implemented as a macro.</p>

<p>BIO_set_mem_buf() sets the internal BUF_MEM structure to <b>bm</b> and sets the close flag to <b>c</b>, that is <b>c</b> should be either BIO_CLOSE or BIO_NOCLOSE. It is a macro.</p>

<p>BIO_get_mem_ptr() places the underlying BUF_MEM structure in <b>pp</b>. It is a macro.</p>

<p>BIO_new_mem_buf() creates a memory BIO using <b>len</b> bytes of data at <b>buf</b>, if <b>len</b> is -1 then the <b>buf</b> is assumed to be null terminated and its length is determined by <b>strlen</b>. The BIO is set to a read only state and as a result cannot be written to. This is useful when some data needs to be made available from a static area of memory in the form of a BIO. The supplied data is read directly from the supplied buffer: it is <b>not</b> copied first, so the supplied area of memory must be unchanged until the BIO is freed.</p>

<h1 id="NOTES">NOTES</h1>

<p>Writes to memory BIOs will always succeed if memory is available: that is their size can grow indefinitely.</p>

<p>Every read from a read write memory BIO will remove the data just read with an internal copy operation, if a BIO contains a lot of data and it is read in small chunks the operation can be very slow. The use of a read only memory BIO avoids this problem. If the BIO must be read write then adding a buffering BIO to the chain will speed up the process.</p>

<h1 id="BUGS">BUGS</h1>

<p>There should be an option to set the maximum size of a memory BIO.</p>

<p>There should be a way to &quot;rewind&quot; a read write BIO without destroying its contents.</p>

<p>The copying operation should not occur after every small read of a large BIO to improve efficiency.</p>

<h1 id="EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</h1>

<p>Create a memory BIO and write some data to it:</p>

<pre><code> BIO *mem = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());
 BIO_puts(mem, &quot;Hello World\n&quot;); </code></pre>

<p>Create a read only memory BIO:</p>

<pre><code> char data[] = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
 BIO *mem;
 mem = BIO_new_mem_buf(data, -1);</code></pre>

<p>Extract the BUF_MEM structure from a memory BIO and then free up the BIO:</p>

<pre><code> BUF_MEM *bptr;
 BIO_get_mem_ptr(mem, &amp;bptr);
 BIO_set_close(mem, BIO_NOCLOSE); /* So BIO_free() leaves BUF_MEM alone */
 BIO_free(mem);
 </code></pre>
