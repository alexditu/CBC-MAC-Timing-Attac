<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>Since the introduction of the ENGINE API, the recommended way of controlling default implementations is by using the ENGINE API functions. The default <b>RAND_METHOD</b>, as set by RAND_set_rand_method() and returned by RAND_get_rand_method(), is only used if no ENGINE has been set as the default &quot;rand&quot; implementation. Hence, these two functions are no longer the recommened way to control defaults.</p>

<p>If an alternative <b>RAND_METHOD</b> implementation is being used (either set directly or as provided by an ENGINE module), then it is entirely responsible for the generation and management of a cryptographically secure PRNG stream. The mechanisms described below relate solely to the software PRNG implementation built in to OpenSSL and used by default.</p>

<p>These functions implement a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). It is used by other library functions for example to generate random keys, and applications can use it when they need randomness.</p>

<p>A cryptographic PRNG must be seeded with unpredictable data such as mouse movements or keys pressed at random by the user. This is described in <a href="../../crypto/RAND_add.html">RAND_add</a>. Its state can be saved in a seed file (see <a href="../../crypto/RAND_load_file.html">RAND_load_file</a>) to avoid having to go through the seeding process whenever the application is started.</p>

<p><a href="../../crypto/RAND_bytes.html">RAND_bytes</a> describes how to obtain random data from the PRNG.</p>

<h1 id="INTERNALS">INTERNALS</h1>

<p>The RAND_SSLeay() method implements a PRNG based on a cryptographic hash function.</p>

<p>The following description of its design is based on the SSLeay documentation:</p>

<p>First up I will state the things I believe I need for a good RNG.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>A good hashing algorithm to mix things up and to convert the RNG &#39;state&#39; to random numbers.</p>

</li>
<li><p>An initial source of random &#39;state&#39;.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The state should be very large. If the RNG is being used to generate 4096 bit RSA keys, 2 2048 bit random strings are required (at a minimum). If your RNG state only has 128 bits, you are obviously limiting the search space to 128 bits, not 2048. I&#39;m probably getting a little carried away on this last point but it does indicate that it may not be a bad idea to keep quite a lot of RNG state. It should be easier to break a cipher than guess the RNG seed data.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Any RNG seed data should influence all subsequent random numbers generated. This implies that any random seed data entered will have an influence on all subsequent random numbers generated.</p>

</li>
<li><p>When using data to seed the RNG state, the data used should not be extractable from the RNG state. I believe this should be a requirement because one possible source of &#39;secret&#39; semi random data would be a private key or a password. This data must not be disclosed by either subsequent random numbers or a &#39;core&#39; dump left by a program crash.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Given the same initial &#39;state&#39;, 2 systems should deviate in their RNG state (and hence the random numbers generated) over time if at all possible.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Given the random number output stream, it should not be possible to determine the RNG state or the next random number.</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>The algorithm is as follows.</p>

<p>There is global state made up of a 1023 byte buffer (the &#39;state&#39;), a working hash value (&#39;md&#39;), and a counter (&#39;count&#39;).</p>

<p>Whenever seed data is added, it is inserted into the &#39;state&#39; as follows.</p>

<p>The input is chopped up into units of 20 bytes (or less for the last block). Each of these blocks is run through the hash function as follows: The data passed to the hash function is the current &#39;md&#39;, the same number of bytes from the &#39;state&#39; (the location determined by in incremented looping index) as the current &#39;block&#39;, the new key data &#39;block&#39;, and &#39;count&#39; (which is incremented after each use). The result of this is kept in &#39;md&#39; and also xored into the &#39;state&#39; at the same locations that were used as input into the hash function. I believe this system addresses points 1 (hash function; currently SHA-1), 3 (the &#39;state&#39;), 4 (via the &#39;md&#39;), 5 (by the use of a hash function and xor).</p>

<p>When bytes are extracted from the RNG, the following process is used. For each group of 10 bytes (or less), we do the following:</p>

<p>Input into the hash function the local &#39;md&#39; (which is initialized from the global &#39;md&#39; before any bytes are generated), the bytes that are to be overwritten by the random bytes, and bytes from the &#39;state&#39; (incrementing looping index). From this digest output (which is kept in &#39;md&#39;), the top (up to) 10 bytes are returned to the caller and the bottom 10 bytes are xored into the &#39;state&#39;.</p>

<p>Finally, after we have finished &#39;num&#39; random bytes for the caller, &#39;count&#39; (which is incremented) and the local and global &#39;md&#39; are fed into the hash function and the results are kept in the global &#39;md&#39;.</p>

<p>I believe the above addressed points 1 (use of SHA-1), 6 (by hashing into the &#39;state&#39; the &#39;old&#39; data from the caller that is about to be overwritten) and 7 (by not using the 10 bytes given to the caller to update the &#39;state&#39;, but they are used to update &#39;md&#39;).</p>

<p>So of the points raised, only 2 is not addressed (but see <a href="../../crypto/RAND_add.html">RAND_add</a>).</p>
