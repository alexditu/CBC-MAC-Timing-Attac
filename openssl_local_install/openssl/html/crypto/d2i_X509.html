<p>d2i_X509, i2d_X509, d2i_X509_bio, d2i_X509_fp, i2d_X509_bio, i2d_X509_fp - X509 encode and decode functions</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code> #include &lt;openssl/x509.h&gt;

 X509 *d2i_X509(X509 **px, const unsigned char **in, int len);
 int i2d_X509(X509 *x, unsigned char **out);

 X509 *d2i_X509_bio(BIO *bp, X509 **x);
 X509 *d2i_X509_fp(FILE *fp, X509 **x);

 int i2d_X509_bio(BIO *bp, X509 *x);
 int i2d_X509_fp(FILE *fp, X509 *x);</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The X509 encode and decode routines encode and parse an <b>X509</b> structure, which represents an X509 certificate.</p>

<p>d2i_X509() attempts to decode <b>len</b> bytes at <b>*in</b>. If successful a pointer to the <b>X509</b> structure is returned. If an error occurred then <b>NULL</b> is returned. If <b>px</b> is not <b>NULL</b> then the returned structure is written to <b>*px</b>. If <b>*px</b> is not <b>NULL</b> then it is assumed that <b>*px</b> contains a valid <b>X509</b> structure and an attempt is made to reuse it. If the call is successful <b>*in</b> is incremented to the byte following the parsed data.</p>

<p>i2d_X509() encodes the structure pointed to by <b>x</b> into DER format. If <b>out</b> is not <b>NULL</b> is writes the DER encoded data to the buffer at <b>*out</b>, and increments it to point after the data just written. If the return value is negative an error occurred, otherwise it returns the length of the encoded data.</p>

<p>For OpenSSL 0.9.7 and later if <b>*out</b> is <b>NULL</b> memory will be allocated for a buffer and the encoded data written to it. In this case <b>*out</b> is not incremented and it points to the start of the data just written.</p>

<p>d2i_X509_bio() is similar to d2i_X509() except it attempts to parse data from BIO <b>bp</b>.</p>

<p>d2i_X509_fp() is similar to d2i_X509() except it attempts to parse data from FILE pointer <b>fp</b>.</p>

<p>i2d_X509_bio() is similar to i2d_X509() except it writes the encoding of the structure <b>x</b> to BIO <b>bp</b> and it returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.</p>

<p>i2d_X509_fp() is similar to i2d_X509() except it writes the encoding of the structure <b>x</b> to BIO <b>bp</b> and it returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.</p>

<h1 id="NOTES">NOTES</h1>

<p>The letters <b>i</b> and <b>d</b> in for example <b>i2d_X509</b> stand for &quot;internal&quot; (that is an internal C structure) and &quot;DER&quot;. So that <b>i2d_X509</b> converts from internal to DER.</p>

<p>The functions can also understand <b>BER</b> forms.</p>

<p>The actual X509 structure passed to i2d_X509() must be a valid populated <b>X509</b> structure it can <b>not</b> simply be fed with an empty structure such as that returned by X509_new().</p>

<p>The encoded data is in binary form and may contain embedded zeroes. Therefore any FILE pointers or BIOs should be opened in binary mode. Functions such as <b>strlen()</b> will <b>not</b> return the correct length of the encoded structure.</p>

<p>The ways that <b>*in</b> and <b>*out</b> are incremented after the operation can trap the unwary. See the <b>WARNINGS</b> section for some common errors.</p>

<p>The reason for the auto increment behaviour is to reflect a typical usage of ASN1 functions: after one structure is encoded or decoded another will processed after it.</p>

<h1 id="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</h1>

<p>Allocate and encode the DER encoding of an X509 structure:</p>

<pre><code> int len;
 unsigned char *buf, *p;

 len = i2d_X509(x, NULL);

 buf = OPENSSL_malloc(len);

 if (buf == NULL)
        /* error */

 p = buf;

 i2d_X509(x, &amp;p);</code></pre>

<p>If you are using OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later then this can be simplified to:</p>

<pre><code> int len;
 unsigned char *buf;

 buf = NULL;

 len = i2d_X509(x, &amp;buf);

 if (len &lt; 0)
        /* error */</code></pre>

<p>Attempt to decode a buffer:</p>

<pre><code> X509 *x;

 unsigned char *buf, *p;

 int len;

 /* Something to setup buf and len */

 p = buf;

 x = d2i_X509(NULL, &amp;p, len);

 if (x == NULL)
    /* Some error */</code></pre>

<p>Alternative technique:</p>

<pre><code> X509 *x;

 unsigned char *buf, *p;

 int len;

 /* Something to setup buf and len */

 p = buf;

 x = NULL;

 if(!d2i_X509(&amp;x, &amp;p, len))
    /* Some error */</code></pre>

<h1 id="WARNINGS">WARNINGS</h1>

<p>The use of temporary variable is mandatory. A common mistake is to attempt to use a buffer directly as follows:</p>

<pre><code> int len;
 unsigned char *buf;

 len = i2d_X509(x, NULL);

 buf = OPENSSL_malloc(len);

 if (buf == NULL)
        /* error */

 i2d_X509(x, &amp;buf);

 /* Other stuff ... */

 OPENSSL_free(buf);</code></pre>

<p>This code will result in <b>buf</b> apparently containing garbage because it was incremented after the call to point after the data just written. Also <b>buf</b> will no longer contain the pointer allocated by <b>OPENSSL_malloc()</b> and the subsequent call to <b>OPENSSL_free()</b> may well crash.</p>

<p>The auto allocation feature (setting buf to NULL) only works on OpenSSL 0.9.7 and later. Attempts to use it on earlier versions will typically cause a segmentation violation.</p>

<p>Another trap to avoid is misuse of the <b>xp</b> argument to <b>d2i_X509()</b>:</p>

<pre><code> X509 *x;

 if (!d2i_X509(&amp;x, &amp;p, len))
        /* Some error */</code></pre>

<p>This will probably crash somewhere in <b>d2i_X509()</b>. The reason for this is that the variable <b>x</b> is uninitialized and an attempt will be made to interpret its (invalid) value as an <b>X509</b> structure, typically causing a segmentation violation. If <b>x</b> is set to NULL first then this will not happen.</p>

<h1 id="BUGS">BUGS</h1>

<p>In some versions of OpenSSL the &quot;reuse&quot; behaviour of d2i_X509() when <b>*px</b> is valid is broken and some parts of the reused structure may persist if they are not present in the new one. As a result the use of this &quot;reuse&quot; behaviour is strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>i2d_X509() will not return an error in many versions of OpenSSL, if mandatory fields are not initialized due to a programming error then the encoded structure may contain invalid data or omit the fields entirely and will not be parsed by d2i_X509(). This may be fixed in future so code should not assume that i2d_X509() will always succeed.</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>d2i_X509(), d2i_X509_bio() and d2i_X509_fp() return a valid <b>X509</b> structure or <b>NULL</b> if an error occurs. The error code that can be obtained by <a href="../../crypto/ERR_get_error.html">ERR_get_error</a>.</p>

<p>i2d_X509() returns the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value if an error occurs. The error code can be obtained by <a href="../../crypto/ERR_get_error.html">ERR_get_error</a>.</p>

<p>i2d_X509_bio() and i2d_X509_fp() return 1 for success and 0 if an error occurs The error code can be obtained by <a href="../../crypto/ERR_get_error.html">ERR_get_error</a>.</p>
