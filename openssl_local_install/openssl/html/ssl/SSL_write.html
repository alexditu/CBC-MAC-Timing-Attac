<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>SSL_write - write bytes to a TLS/SSL connection.</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code> #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

 int SSL_write(SSL *ssl, const void *buf, int num);</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>SSL_write() writes <b>num</b> bytes from the buffer <b>buf</b> into the specified <b>ssl</b> connection.</p>

<h1 id="NOTES">NOTES</h1>

<p>If necessary, SSL_write() will negotiate a TLS/SSL session, if not already explicitly performed by <a href="../../ssl/SSL_connect.html">SSL_connect</a> or <a href="../../ssl/SSL_accept.html">SSL_accept</a>. If the peer requests a re-negotiation, it will be performed transparently during the SSL_write() operation. The behaviour of SSL_write() depends on the underlying BIO.</p>

<p>For the transparent negotiation to succeed, the <b>ssl</b> must have been initialized to client or server mode. This is being done by calling <a href="../../ssl/SSL_set_connect_state.html">SSL_set_connect_state</a> or SSL_set_accept_state() before the first call to an <a href="../../ssl/SSL_read.html">SSL_read</a> or SSL_write() function.</p>

<p>If the underlying BIO is <b>blocking</b>, SSL_write() will only return, once the write operation has been finished or an error occurred, except when a renegotiation take place, in which case a SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ may occur. This behaviour can be controlled with the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag of the <a href="../../ssl/SSL_CTX_set_mode.html">SSL_CTX_set_mode</a> call.</p>

<p>If the underlying BIO is <b>non-blocking</b>, SSL_write() will also return, when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of SSL_write() to continue the operation. In this case a call to <a href="../../ssl/SSL_get_error.html">SSL_get_error</a> with the return value of SSL_write() will yield <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</b> or <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</b>. As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a call to SSL_write() can also cause read operations! The calling process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy the needs of SSL_write(). The action depends on the underlying BIO. When using a non-blocking socket, nothing is to be done, but select() can be used to check for the required condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.</p>

<p>SSL_write() will only return with success, when the complete contents of <b>buf</b> of length <b>num</b> has been written. This default behaviour can be changed with the SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE option of <a href="../../ssl/SSL_CTX_set_mode.html">SSL_CTX_set_mode</a>. When this flag is set, SSL_write() will also return with success, when a partial write has been successfully completed. In this case the SSL_write() operation is considered completed. The bytes are sent and a new SSL_write() operation with a new buffer (with the already sent bytes removed) must be started. A partial write is performed with the size of a message block, which is 16kB for SSLv3/TLSv1.</p>

<h1 id="WARNING">WARNING</h1>

<p>When an SSL_write() operation has to be repeated because of <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</b> or <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</b>, it must be repeated with the same arguments.</p>

<p>When calling SSL_write() with num=0 bytes to be sent the behaviour is undefined.</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>The following return values can occur:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="pod0">&gt;0</dt>
<dd>

<p>The write operation was successful, the return value is the number of bytes actually written to the TLS/SSL connection.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod01">0</dt>
<dd>

<p>The write operation was not successful. Probably the underlying connection was closed. Call SSL_get_error() with the return value <b>ret</b> to find out, whether an error occurred or the connection was shut down cleanly (SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN).</p>

<p>SSLv2 (deprecated) does not support a shutdown alert protocol, so it can only be detected, whether the underlying connection was closed. It cannot be checked, why the closure happened.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="pod02">&lt;0</dt>
<dd>

<p>The write operation was not successful, because either an error occurred or action must be taken by the calling process. Call SSL_get_error() with the return value <b>ret</b> to find out the reason.</p>

</dd>
